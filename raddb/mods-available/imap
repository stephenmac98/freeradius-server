#  The `imap` module sends TLS requests to a remote imap server and decodes
#  the responses. Can also perform basic auth with user's credentials.

		#
		#  Specifies how the certificate(s) presented by the HTTPS server being contacted
		#  are validated, and which certificates (if any) to send to the HTTPS server.

		#
		#  ca_file:: PEM formatted file containing the chain to validate the HTTPS server's cert
		#
		#  Should usually contain a concatenation of one or more intermediary CA
		#  files, shallowest (i.e. the one that signed the HTTPS server's cert) first, and
		#  deepest (the root CA) last.
		#
		#  Providing a complete certificate chain here is the most common way of validating
		#  the certificate presented by a HTTPS server.

		#  ca_issuer_file:: PEM formatted file containing the CA that signed the HTTPS server's cert
		#
		#  Specifies the certificate that directly signed the certificate presented by the
		#  HTTPS server.
		#
		#  This configuration option can be used to prevent certificates passing validation that
		#  were signed by other intermediary CAs or root CAs in the trusted certificate chain.

		#  |===
		#  | Option | Description
		#  | `no`   | Server certificate CN can be any value.
